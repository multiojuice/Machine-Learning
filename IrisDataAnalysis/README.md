# Iris Data Set Analysis

#### Overview

Apparently, this Iris Data Set is used as the "Hello World!" example in data analysis and machine learning. The Data set can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris). Since this is going to be one of my first encounters in this field, I will be using a tutorial to **Base** my program off of. This tutorial can be found [here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/).


#### Tools

This is written in Python3 with the help of a few of pythons libraries, these being
 1. SciPy
 2. NumPy
 3. Matplotlib
 4. Pandas
 5. Sklearn

All of these can be and were downloaded using pip3.
