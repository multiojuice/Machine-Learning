# Java Neural Net

### Overview
This is a neural net written in java. It is the first one I have attempted to write and seems to be a combination of a few examples I have seen along with the basic understanding I have of neural nets.


### What does it do?
This neural net has the capability of finding a pattern with in a set of data. Right now this set of data must yeild a 1 or 0. The network will guess what the set yeilds based on the original numbers! I am still working out some kinks, so look forward to updates and commits!

### Tools used
For this I simply used java and nothing else, I wanted to see what a neural network looks like at a lower level, in other instances I have used frameworks, but not here.
