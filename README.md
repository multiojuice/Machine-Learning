# Neural Nets & Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository is going to hold all of my simple experimentations with machine learning and neural networks. Some of these projects may be tutorials, most will be projects written on my own. All information will be held in each seperate folders README.md. Each folder will be a seperate project/excerise.

#### Mission

To learn and explore the field of machine learning and data analysis. I have an interest in low level computing, however I want to educate myself in this growing field.

#### Tools

I am going to write most of these in either Python3 or Java, also I will probably end up experimenting a bit with C. Each project will have the specified libraries and tools used for that project in the README.md.
